      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      Community Waste management or waste disposal includes the processes and
      actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal.
      <br />
      Recycling management is the process of planning and controlling how waste
      is recycled and disposed of. It includes managing the storage of
      recyclable materials, obsolete products, and loading equipment.
    </div>
    <div class="Objective" id="Objective-id">
      <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
      Regular waste collection is taken for granted in wealthier parts of the
      world, but there are still two billion people living in lower and middle
      income countries without this basic service. When there is no such
      service, people resort to dumping or burning their waste close to where
      they live. These practices are harmful to public health, local economies
      and the environment, especially in regions near waterways, which prove to
      be a convenient receptacle for urban waste. Plastic packaging waste, for
      example, not only blocks drains and pollutes the ocean, but when burned,
      is harmful to lungs, eyes and skin, and is a major contributor to urban
      air pollution.

      <h2>ACTIONS AND IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
      Community-based waste management programs offer populations in low and
      middle income countries where there is no, or inadequate, municipal waste
      management services with a low-cost, effective and engaging waste
      management system. Such systems encourage: Direct community-member
      engagement and accountability Tracking of waste collection and reduction
      Segregation of waste at the household level On-site utilization of
      valuable and reusable items Composting of organic waste Collection and
      transportation of waste to a treatment site by a public collection
      service.

      <h2>BENEFITS</h2>  
      <b>1. Localized Solutions:</b> <br />

        Community-based waste management allows for tailored solutions that
        consider the unique needs and characteristics of each community. 
        <br />
      <p >
        <b>2. Increased Recycling Rates:</b> <br />
  
         Residents are more likely to sort and recycle their waste when they feel a 
         sense of ownership
        in the waste management process. This leads to higher recycling rates and
        reduced landfill waste. <br />
      <b>3. Job Creation:</b> <br />

      Implementing community-based waste management programs often involves the
      hiring of local staff for collection, sorting, and recycling activities.
      This not only benefits the environment but also contributes to local
      economic development by creating employment opportunities. <br />
      <span><b>4. Educational Opportunities:</b> <br />

        These programs provide a platform for educational initiatives. Workshops,
        seminars, and awareness campaigns can educate community members about the
        importance of waste reduction, recycling, and responsible consumption.
        <br />
      <b>5. Improved Public Health:</b> <br />

      By effectively managing waste, communities can mitigate health hazards
      associated with improper disposal. The reduction of open dumping and
      burning of waste helps prevent air and water pollution, safeguarding the
      health of residents. <br />
      <b>6. Community Engagement and Empowerment:</b> <br />

      Involving residents in waste management decisions empowers them to take an
      active role in shaping their environment. This sense of responsibility and
      engagement fosters a stronger sense of community . <br />
      <b>7. Cost Savings for Local Authorities:</b> <br />

        Efficient community-based waste management programs can alleviate the
        burden on local authorities. Reduced waste collection and disposal costs
        free up resources that can be redirected to other essential community
        services. <br />
      <b>8. Environmental Conservation:</b> <br />

    Community-based programs contribute to environmental conservation by
    minimizing the environmental impact of waste. By emphasizing reduction,
    reuse, and recycling, these programs align with broader sustainability
    goals. <br />

      <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
      In conclusion, community-based waste management programs offer a multitude
      of benefits for both the community and the planet. These programs provide
      localized solutions tailored to the specific needs of each community,
      resulting in increased recycling rates, job creation, and educational
      opportunities. By effectively managing waste, communities can also improve
      public health, engage residents, and empower them to shape their
      environment. Moreover, these programs lead to cost savings for local
      authorities, contribute to environmental conservation, and promote a
      circular economy. Ultimately, successful waste management initiatives
      foster a sense of community pride and contribute to a cleaner, healthier,
      and more sustainable future for all. <br />
